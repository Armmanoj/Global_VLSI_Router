/*
Improvements possible-
1.  Replace read data from file and store data to file with easier to understand names, or/and incorporate them into netlist and grid_graph class
2.  Include all the test fnctions into a seperate cpp file which can be included into main as #include "test_displays.cpp"
3.  Simplify the constructor of netlist and Grid_Graph, to constuct directly from file being read, as well as have a destructor for both, which will store the results appropritely
4.  Simplify the construction of data structure that stores the routes, making sure of how memory is handled in it
5.  Reduce the importance of "Batch" class to near zero, do al routing in some nets class itself
